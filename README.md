# hello-world
My first github repository

My name is Robert Luckett. I earned a B.S. in Computer Science in 1994. I want to develop software in Python and/or Rust, though at the moment I'm going to focus on Python. There seems to be a lot more online resources available for Python than there are for Rust.
